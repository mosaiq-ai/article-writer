   - Search and retrieval capabilities

## Major Technical Decisions

### 1. Tool-Based Document Access vs Vector Database
**Decision:** Implemented tool-based document access instead of vector database approach

**Rationale:**
- Modern LLMs have massive context windows (Gemini 2.5 Pro: 1M+ tokens, GPT-4: 128K+ tokens)
- Eliminates chunking artifacts and information loss
- Simplifies architecture and reduces costs
- Enables full document context for better accuracy

**Impact:** Significantly improved document analysis quality and simplified system architecture

### 2. Server-Side Agent Execution Architecture
**Decision:** Moved agent execution from client-side to server-side API endpoints

**Rationale:**
- Environment variables only available on server-side in Next.js
- Secure API key handling without exposing credentials to client
- Better error handling and logging capabilities
- Enables proper streaming and progress tracking

**Impact:** Resolved all API key access issues and improved security posture

### 3. Realistic Token Limit Configuration
**Decision:** Updated all model configurations to use realistic completion token limits

**Rationale:**
- GPT-4 supports max 16,384 completion tokens (not 50,000)
- Claude and Gemini have high limits but reasonable defaults improve performance
- Prevents API errors and improves reliability

**Impact:** Eliminated token limit errors and improved agent success rates

### 4. Full Document Processing (No Chunking)
**Decision:** Process and store complete documents without chunking

**Rationale:**
- Leverage modern LLM context capabilities
- Preserve document structure and relationships
- Eliminate context loss from chunking
- Simplify retrieval and analysis

**Impact:** Better document understanding and more accurate AI responses

## Major Challenges and Solutions

### 1. **API Key Environment Variable Access Issues** ðŸ”¥
**Challenge:** Agents couldn't access environment variables when running on client-side
```
Error: AI_LoadAPIKeyError: OpenAI API key is missing. Pass it using the 'apiKey' parameter or the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.
```

**Root Cause:** Next.js environment variables are only available server-side unless prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`

**Solution:**
- Created server-side API endpoint (`/api/agents/flow`) for agent execution
- Updated test interface to call server-side API instead of running agents client-side
- Added environment variable debugging endpoint (`/api/env-check`)
- Implemented proper client-server architecture

**Result:** âœ… All API keys now accessible, agents execute successfully

### 2. **Token Limit Configuration Errors** ðŸ”¥
**Challenge:** Agents failing with token limit errors
```
Error: max_tokens is too large: 50000. This model supports at most 16384 completion tokens
```

**Root Cause:** Confusion between context window size and completion token limits

**Solution:**
- Updated model configurations with correct completion token limits:
  - GPT-4: 4,096 tokens (was 50,000)
  - Claude: 8,192 tokens (was 200,000)
  - Gemini: 8,192 tokens (was 1,000,000)
- Fixed agent default token usage

**Result:** âœ… All agents now complete successfully without token errors

### 3. Gemini Model Configuration Issues
**Challenge:** Initial Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview model required paid quota
```
Error: "Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview doesn't have a free quota tier"
```

**Solution:** 
- Switched to `gemini-1.5-flash` for free tier compatibility
- Later migrated entire system to use GPT-4o as default
- Implemented proper model fallback logic

**Lesson Learned:** Always verify model availability and quota requirements before implementation

### 4. **Tailwind CSS v4 Compatibility Issues** ðŸ”¥
**Challenge:** Multiple Tailwind CSS errors due to version 4.1.7 incompatibilities
```
Error: Cannot apply unknown utility class: text-4xl, text-5xl, text-3xl
```

**Root Cause:** Tailwind CSS v4 has breaking changes from v3.x

**Solution:**
- Updated all problematic text size classes:
  - `text-3xl` â†’ `text-2xl`
  - Removed `text-4xl` and `text-5xl` usage
- Fixed typography system for v4 compatibility

**Result:** âœ… All compilation errors resolved

### 5. PDF Processing Library Conflicts
**Challenge:** `pdf-parse` library causing file system errors

**Final Solution:**
- Removed all PDF processing libraries
- Implemented placeholder PDF processor
- Focused on getting core system working first

**Lesson Learned:** Sometimes it's better to implement placeholders and move forward rather than getting stuck on specific library issues

### 6. Next.js Caching and Server Issues
**Challenge:** Next.js cache holding onto old code and port conflicts

**Solution:**
- Multiple server restarts with `.next` directory deletion
- Cleared all caches and rebuilt from scratch
- Implemented proper error boundaries

**Lesson Learned:** Next.js development cache can be aggressive; regular cache clearing is essential during major changes
